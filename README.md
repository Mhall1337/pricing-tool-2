# README
I built this app for my phase 5 project in Flatiron's sofware engineering program. The purpose of the app is to offer a template of a potential tool trucking companies can use to better access and utilize their own data. It can be used to make decisions based on internal data, help source truck capacity, or retrieve shipment data relative to a radius around a location, and provides a place to create/store a carrier list unique to and individual user. This app currently uses fake data which can be subsituted with real shipment info.



To start the front-end server, enter this into the terminal:
    npm start --prefix client

    Or you can cd into the client folder and enter
    npm start

To start the rails server enter:
    rails s

Make sure to isntall the dependencies with:
    npm install

This app uses a GoogleMaps API key, so the user would be required to obtain one through the Google Maps API to use the search by radius function in the Maps component. An API key can be obtained from the link below:

* Ruby version:
    ruby 2.7.4
